## ESP32_D0WD_Q6 Patch ESP-IDF v5.2 in LINUX (UBUNTU)
# Introduction
ESP32 chips do have a new function **esp_wifi_80211_tx()** which is used to send router raw frames.

# Problem
They made a function to filter frames that may be illegal( **deauthentification or dissociation frames** ).

Sadly, **this filter sanity function sits inside their precompiled library** and can't be modified in c code.

I saw many guys reporting all this over forums that **'c0' deauth frame not working**.
```
E (1084305) wifi:unsupport frame type: 0c0
```
# Solution
Spent several hours analyzing decompiled library which is **libnet80211.a**

Library has several object files merged together

Function **esp_wifi_80211_tx()** sits inside :
**libnet80211.a -> ieee80211_output.o**

I disassembled and edited some registers inside **'ieee80211_output.o'** object file so that **sanity check function result will be ignored and you can now send any packet.**

Still left check for length **(length >= 24)**

# How to setup
1. Download **'libnet80211.a'** from this repo (current one compiled using **ESP-IDF v5.2**)
2. Copy to folder **$your_esp_location/esp/esp-idf/components/esp_wifi/lib/esp32/** and replace older one
3. Try compile your project now, **if it not compiling, you can try manually inject ieee80211_output.o to your existing libnet80211.a**
4. In that case download **'ieee80211_output.o'** from this repo
5. Copy to folder **$your_esp_location/esp/esp-idf/components/esp_wifi/lib/esp32/**
6. Run Following commands
```
cd $your_esp_location/esp/esp-idf/components/esp_wifi/lib/esp32/
ar rcs libnet80211.a ieee80211_output.o
```
7. Now it should be injected, try compile your project
8. If still cannot compile, it means something changed inside **'ieee80211_output.o'** due newer espressif version
9. 
# Results
**Frame sending deauth worked :)**
